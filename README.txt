Hi everyone,
this is a python calculator code.
This calculator is very simple, primitive.
It looks like windows xp calculator.
I made as many code hints as possible if anyone needs code explanations

imported files:
- tkinter
https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
- decimal
https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html
